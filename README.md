Anthony's Insight! - Personal Portfolio Website

This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website, "Anthony's Insight!". It is a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional narrative to potential employers.
Features

    Single-Page Layout: A smooth, single-page experience with scroll-to-section navigation.
    Responsive Design: Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
    Dynamic Animations: Subtle and professional scroll-triggered animations using the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library to enhance user experience.
    Interactive Project Carousel: A touch-friendly, interactive carousel built with Swiper.js to showcase significant projects.
    Functional Contact Form: An integrated contact form that sends submissions directly to my email using Formspree, without requiring a backend server.
    External Resume Link: A styled, clickable link that directs visitors to my full resume hosted on Google Docs.
    Dynamic Footer: The footer includes a copyright notice with a year that updates automatically using JavaScript.
